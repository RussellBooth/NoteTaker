  ## Installation

  NodeJS is required to run the program, as well as the fs, express, and path built-in functionalities of javascript.

  ## Usage

  The instructions for use is to run 'node server.js' in the terminal then run the application on localhost:3001 (or the accessible port found). The taken notes appear on the left hand side of the screen and the right side is where titles for notes, and the body of the notes are entered. The notes are saved using the save note button at the top of the screen, as well as a button to clear the form if the note is not entered in correctly.
